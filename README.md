# Build and run
Simple `./gradlew run` from the root repository.
PHP files for the test are stored in `main/resourses/php`. The result represented in the file `main/resourses.txt/result.txt`

PS. There is also a template for getting `*.php` files from a custom repository. But I failed to beat GitHub cooldown for the number of requests.
